# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Learning how to work on various parts of creating a webpage is a challenging and useful way to exercise front end development skills. In future projects, I would like to include more opportunities on showcasing animation skills and learn more css tips and tricks to help improve the functionality and visual appeal of the webpage. After completeing this project, I see the benefit of practicing BEM methodology and look forward to improving my skills in the future. From the skills that I have learned, I have gained so much respect for software engineers that have created beautiful webpages and appreciate what was put into creating a more welcoming user experience.
